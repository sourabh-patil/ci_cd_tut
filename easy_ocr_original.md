## The Implementation Activities for Training Group II and III Companies under NIGERIA HCFC PHASE-OUT MANAGEMENT PLAN STAGE III 190173

## 1. ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND

The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is the specialized agency of the United Nations that promotes industrial development for poverty reduction, inclusive globalization and environmental sustainability.  The mission of UNIDO, as described in the Lima Declaration adopted at the fifteenth session of the UNIDO General Conference in 2013 as well as the Abu Dhabi Declaration adopted at the eighteenth session of UNIDO General Conference in 2019, is to promote and accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) in Member States. The relevance of ISID as an integrated approach to all three pillars of sustainable development is recognized by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will frame United  Nations  and  country  efforts  towards  sustainable  development.  UNIDO's  mandate  is  fully recognized in SDG9, which calls to 'Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foste r innovation'. The relevance of ISID, however, applies in greater or lesser extent to all SDGs. Accordingly, the Organization's programmatic focus is structured in four strategic priorities:  Creating  shared  prosperity;  Advancing  economic  competitiveness;  Safeguarding  the environment; and Strengthening knowledge and institutions.

Each of these programmatic fields of activity contains a number of individual programmes, which are implemented in a holistic manner to achieve effective outcomes and impacts through UNIDO's four enabling functions: (i) technical cooperation; (ii) analytical and research functions and policy advisory services; (iii) normative functions and standards and quality-related activities; and (iv) convening and partnerships for knowledge transfer, networking and industrial cooperation. Such core functions are carried out in Departments/Offices in its Headquarters, Regional Offices and Hubs and Country Offices.

The present task is within Montreal Protocol Unit (TCS/MPD) and the incumbent reports to the project manager in the unit.  The MPD is responsible for planning, developing and implementing activities in Member  States  to  facilitate  compliance  with  the  Montreal  Protocol  and, in  particular,  it's  Kigali Amendment and to support countries to achieve their determined contributions to reduce emissions of  greenhouse  gases  under  the  Paris  Agreement.  Making  use  of  the  capacity  building  and  policy support, the services of the Unit foster transformation in manufacturing concerning technologies used in  the  refrigeration,  air  conditioning  and  insulation  with  the  effect  of  a  reduction  and  change  in working fluids and chemicals and ultimately a reduction of total greenhouse gas emissions.

## PROJECT CONTEXT

The HPMP for Nigeria, approved at the 62nd meeting of the Executive Committee, will result in the complete phase-out of HCFCs in Nigeria by 1st January 2040 in line with the obligation taken by the

Government of Nigeria under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. This is  based  on  the  combination of interrelated institutional and regulatory measures and investment activities including conversion of production facilities and strengthening of national capacities for local manufacture  of  hydrocarbon-based  alternative  refrigerants.  UNDP  is  the  lead  agency  for  the implementation of this plan, UNIDO being the cooperating agency. Nigeria obtained financial support from the Multilateral Fund for the first stage, which resulted in the country attaining its 10% phaseout  target  of  the  baseline  level  by  2015.  Nigeria  also  obtained  at  the  81st  Executive  Committee Meeting in June 2018 approval for its Second Stage of the HPMP, for a phase-out of 51.35% by 2023. For Stage II, UNDP was the coordinating agency, and both UNIDO and the Government of Italy are cooperating agencies.

After the ExCom Decision 81/40(c) noted that 'approval of stage II of the HPMP did not preclude Nigeria from submitting, the 91st ExCom approved the HPMP Stage III.

## Phase-out of HCFC-22 in the commercial refrigeration manufacturing sector

In the Nigeria market, there are already equipment using HC refrigerants on sale. The market and customers  have  gradually  accepted  such  equipment  and  have  certain  application  foundation  and experience.

For the refrigerator, freezer, ice maker and RAC sector, the charging amounts of these refrigeration equipment are relatively small, and the overall design does not need after-sales installation (except RAC), so the risk of leakage is low. As an environmentally friendly high-performance refrigerant, HC can be used in small charges. At the same time, the compressor and other main parts are sufficiently supplied with many varieties, which can be applied to different refrigeration systems. The survey conducted in 2019 renewed the country's portfolio of small and medium manufacturing companies in the field of commercial refrigeration. For eligible companies, the total HCFC-22 consumption in this sector is 232.29 MT (12.78 ODP tonnes) in 2019. Among them, 1 company consume more than 6 MT, 13 companies in the range of 3 to 6 MT, 53 companies less than 3 MT, and 115 companies less than 1MT.

UNIDO's survey of HCFC consumption in the RAC manufacturing sector conducted in 2019 showed that  out  of  259  companies  surveyed,  only  183  companies  in  the  commercial  refrigeration manufacturing sector and 2 companies in air-conditioning manufacturing sector were found eligible to receive MLF support to phase out HCFC-22. Of the 185 eligible companies, only two produce air conditioning  equipment,  while  other  companies  produce  ice  block  making  machines  for  walk-in refrigerators/freezers or install the walk-in refrigerators/freezers.

With the MLF Secretariat's encouragement during its recent review of energy efficiency projects, it is convincing that R290 (not R32) technologies should be fully promoted in the commercial refrigeration sector. This choice has been supported by the fact that Sanden Intercool in Nigeria has fully converted its manufacturing line to R290. In April 2024, a training on the safe handling of R290 was conducted for  13  companies  of  group  I  in  Lagos  and  Ibadan  respectively.  The  R290  training  mainly  targeted commercial refrigeration manufacturers and assemblers. They were engaged in assembling, installing, and maintaining various types of refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment including cold rooms, ice making machines, central and residential AC, etc.

## Kigali Implementation Plan (KIP) in Nigeria

Nigeria ratified the Kigali Amendment in 2018. The enabling activities funded by the Multilateral Fund with support from UNEP, assisted Nigeria in creating awareness of HFC phase-down, and supported the amendment of the National Environmental (Ozone Layer Protection) regulations. However, it was only in 2022, after the adoption of the amendment of the ODS regulation, that Nigeria started the

implementation of the licensing system for HFCs. Quota allocations will be implemented fully in 2025 with the implementation of the KIP.

HCFC consumption of Nigeria in 2023 reached 1,844MT. Implementing agencies including UNDP and UNIDO are supporting Nigeria on the implementation of stage II and Stage III HPMP in parallel, Stage IV of the HPMP will be developed to completely phase out HCFCs by 2030. It is expected that HPMP and  KIP  could  be  designed  and  implemented  in  a  complementary  manner  to  strengthen  the infrastructure and capacity of the country for a sustainable HCFC phase-out and HFC phasing down for Nigeria.

In order to promote and accelerate the phase-down of HCFC and shift towards low GWP alternatives, the eligible companies are divided into three groups in designing the technical assistance in Stage III:

- i) Individual Conversion: Solutions for the enterprises will be highly customized and HC will be  selected  wherever  possible.  Efforts  would  be  made  to  understand  each  company's situation and capacity, and tailor-made solutions would be proposed and implemented;
2. ii) Group  Conversion  1: The enterprises  could  choose  from  ready-made  equipment components needed for handling HC-290 within the project budget. The companies could choose to incorporate additional solutions with additional payments; and
3. iii) Group Conversion 2: The enterprises would be  provided  with  technical  assistance  and training.
4. iv) Group Conversion 3: The enterprises would be  provided  with  technical  assistance  and training.
